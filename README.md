# Churn with PySpark

I have developed a basic customer churn prediction project using PySpark. You can refer to the Python file in this repository to understand how to efficiently build a machine learning model with PySpark.
Feel free to explore the code to gain insights and ideas for creating your own ML models using PySpark.
